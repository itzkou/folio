This experience has taught me a lot, from managing a large scale mobile banking application to interacting with a wonderful team that aims to serve a consistent codebase and satisfy clients in my homeland. The workflow at Value allowed me to get more consistent experience in agile projects thanks to scrum principles that are perfectly applied here. I am so honored to be part of this experience. Currently I am responsible of migrating the application to jetpack compose and maintain its performance by using native tools and profilers.
